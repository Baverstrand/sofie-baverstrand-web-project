Good morning!
The list from yesterday completed as far as possible. Index page and login page are still to get som content. 
I translated the about-page to get a more cohesive feel about the page. Chuck is not the same in Swedish. 
I also rearranged the input boxes in order to get them more responsive to both different screens and to get them more ajusted to those who use a Braille-display. 

#### Today's list:
* Add alt- text to every link and image
* Come up with something to put on the landing page
* Start with the login feature again. 

## 2021-02-22 08.37

#### Today's list:
* Finish the header layout
* Apply header design to footer
* Finish content design

#### Plus menu
* Write some text for index page

## 2021-02-21 later

Fixed the header text from blocking links with z-axis.

The weekend has offered a small amount of extra time here and there, and I've tried to get the css part started a bit. Some progress in the design bit.
Tomorrow I will try to find a "sticky header" feature aswell.

Yesterday I got the API-part working. Extremely nice!

#### Today's list

* Create content for the API page
* Explore more call possibilities

## 2021-02-18 16.57

Lecture lasted longer than expected. Calling API is getting closer at least.
I have decided to put the login part aside for now. Following instructions to the point does not work yet, and there is no point in wasting precious time.

## 2021-02-18 09.56

After a very long and frustrating session with Okta, I decided to leave it for now. Instead I think I've found a suitable API to use.

#### Today's list:

* Create .js for the project
* Get started with the connection

Since today is lecture day, I don't know how much is possible to expect. I have no idea how much time the lecture will take.

## 2021-02-17 09.36

Today will be the grand Login Day. If I can make it work, I will have time to start checking out APIs to work with.
I have some ideas. I'm also really keen on getting started with .css since I think it's fun even if I'm no expert.

#### Today's list:

* Get the login up and running
* Check out possibilities for logout aswell
* Continue browsing for APIs

#### Plus Menu

* Company name and logo
* .css styles

## 2021-02-16 15.37

Most of today's list is done. I've started to look at the Okta-solution and I will give it a serious try.

## 2021-02-16 09.04

Switching over to English since I understood that's the way to do it.
Yesterday I finished the list as planned. I also made some research to get an idea of what I want my page to look like.

#### Today's list:

* Translate this document to have it cohesive
* Transfer the structure to issues
* Create all .html pages in VSCode
