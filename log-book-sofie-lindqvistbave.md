Final day for this project. Time to wrap this up!
Yesterday was a pretty productive day. I dare say the page is finished and final. I have been a bit back and forth about splitting up the .js- file to three, but I think it's the right decision. 
The pitch presentation is almost finished. I have one last thing to check before I start recording.

#### Today's list
* Check out screenreader
* Finish comments on code
* Close issues on project board
* Start recording
* Zip up and submit!

#### Plus menu
* Get some screenreader stuff in presentation

Evening check-in. Today's list is completed. I finished the PowerPoint for the presentation.

Good morning!
Yesterday I managed to get a lot of things done. The list was checked off, but I have focused on crucial parts rather than login. I looked at it briefly, but will continue today. 
I managed to sort out how to use generic code for header and footer. After a long phone conversation with an old friend who is visually impaired, I decided to add a CSS-free version of the page. Only minor changes needed (like an image size and such). The CSS-free version is better for both screenreaders which translates to a braille display in combination with speech and zooming software. For example, a screenreader can have trouble finding a link which is not underlined. 
I have tested the page with different screen sizes, and it looks good! Today I will put the page live for a while and have my test crew checking out the page with different devices, browsers and also a Mac. Also today is lecture day. 

#### Today's list:
* Put page live for testing
* Let test crew do their thing with Android device, Mac, and different browsers. Have them take screenshots for documentation. 
* Finish redesign of project board
* Start with some kind of plan for video presentation. 

#### Plus menu
* Sign-in

Done yesterday:
Alt text for picture is in place. I also read some articles about how to describe pictures in a good way. 
The landing page is done. 
I got the Google sign-in to work on a test page, but the redirect is giving me trouble. The Okta solution still won't work. Everything is identical with working setups. No idea why it doesn't work. I will give it a try on a live page today and see what happens. 

#### Today's list:
* Change the code and filenames to adjust to no login
* Lift the login part to another page
* Recruit a test crew with different devices.
* Continue with tests for generic code. 

#### Plus menu
* Remake project board to exactly follow instructions. Convert cards to issues.

Good morning!
The list from yesterday completed as far as possible. Index page and login page are still to get som content. 
I translated the about-page to get a more cohesive feel about the page. Chuck is not the same in Swedish. 
I also rearranged the input boxes in order to get them more responsive to both different screens and to get them more ajusted to those who use a Braille-display. 

#### Today's list:
* Add alt- text to every link and image
* Come up with something to put on the landing page
* Start with the login feature again. 

## 2021-02-22 08.37

#### Today's list:
* Finish the header layout
* Apply header design to footer
* Finish content design

#### Plus menu
* Write some text for index page

## 2021-02-21 later

Fixed the header text from blocking links with z-axis. 

## 2021-02-21 17.42

The weekend has offered a small amount of extra time here and there, and I've tried to get the css part started a bit. Some progress in the design bit.
Tomorrow I will try to find a "sticky header" feature aswell. 

## 2021-02-19 08.07

Yesterday I got the API-part working. Extremely nice!

#### Today's list

* Create content for the API page
* Explore more call possibilities

## 2021-02-18 16.57

Lecture lasted longer than expected. Calling API is getting closer at least.
I have decided to put the login part aside for now. Following instructions to the point does not work yet, and there is no point in wasting precious time.

## 2021-02-18 09.56

After a very long and frustrating session with Okta, I decided to leave it for now. Instead I think I've found a suitable API to use.

#### Today's list:

* Create .js for the project
* Get started with the connection

Since today is lecture day, I don't know how much is possible to expect. I have no idea how much time the lecture will take.

## 2021-02-17 09.36

Today will be the grand Login Day. If I can make it work, I will have time to start checking out APIs to work with.
I have some ideas. I'm also really keen on getting started with .css since I think it's fun even if I'm no expert.

#### Today's list:

* Get the login up and running
* Check out possibilities for logout aswell
* Continue browsing for APIs

#### Plus Menu

* Company name and logo
* .css styles

## 2021-02-16 15.37

Most of today's list is done. I've started to look at the Okta-solution and I will give it a serious try.

## 2021-02-16 09.04

Switching over to English since I understood that's the way to do it.
Yesterday I finished the list as planned. I also made some research to get an idea of what I want my page to look like.

#### Today's list:

* Translate this document to have it cohesive
* Transfer the structure to issues
* Create all .html pages in VSCode
* Start with basic code in those, e.g the header which will be almost identical for all pages

#### Plus Menu
